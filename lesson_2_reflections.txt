1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	-Initialiazing a repository creates a .git file in the directory where it is initialized. This allows you to begin tracking files in that directory from that point forward. You must manually add files to be tracked by the repository.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	-The staging area is a temporary holding place for files that will be added to the repository in the next commit. Their state is in flux. Files in the working directory have one save state, but may have as many versions as there are commits for them in the repository. The staging area allows you to select which files will be added in a commit, so that you can commit logical groups of files rather than commiting all the files in the directory at once.
3) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change? 
	-You can compare the files in the staging area to those in either the working directory or repository to view the differences between them, to ensure that the right amount of code is being added in the next commit.
